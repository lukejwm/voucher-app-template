        <br />
        <h3>
          Brasenose College's ambition is to move towards carbon neutrality. We
          want your voice in our approach.
        </h3>
        <h4>A Step Towards Carbon Neutrality</h4>
        <p>
          Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is essential if we are going to
          prevent potentially catastrophic climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brasenose College is determined to be part of the solution. We are
          stepping up to the challenge by working with students, Fellows and
          staff to select carbon offset projects from around the world that the
          College will support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each project removes, reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions while
          assisting local communities
        </p>
        <h4>What is Carbon Neutrality?</h4>
        <p>
          Our carbon footprint is the greenhouse gas emissions we cause,
          expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). To achieve carbon
          neutrality, we must reduce our carbon footprint and offset any
          outstanding carbon emissions. Carbon emissions can be offset by
          removing the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
          or preventing the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide from entering
          the atmosphere in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recognise that it is important to prioritise reducing emissions,
          which minimises the need for offsets. Equally, offsetting emissions
          can be an important part of an environmental strategy, particularly
          where reducing emissions is challenging or will take time, as is the
          case given our historic buildings.
        </p>
        <h4>A Step Change</h4>
        <p>
          Brasenose College is reducing its carbon footprint by using renewable
          energy sources as well as cutting direct and indirect energy
          consumption. But we acknowledge that we are facing a climate emergency
          and we must do more, now.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why we have teamed up with
          <a href="https://alliedoffsets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopen"
            >AlliedOffsets</a
          >, to offset the carbon emissions from the Collegeâ€™s day to day
          operations. With their help and input from Brasenose students, Fellows
          and staff we will support a number of emissions reduction projects
          around the world.
        </p>
        <h4>Reaching Net Zero Carbon</h4>
        <p>
          Before talking about being carbon neutral, or reaching "net zero
          carbon", we believe it is important to understand what those words
          really mean. How big is our carbon footprint? How much can we reduce
          it? And how quickly? These are difficult and complex questions that we
          are already exploring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile it makes sense to start cutting and offsetting carbon
          emissions straight away. Preventing catastrophic climate change
          tomorrow means taking action today.
        </p>
        <p>
          We embrace our responsibility to do that, and also acknowledge that
          offsetting carbon emissions in no way diminishes the need to cut our
          carbon footprint as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>Research &amp; Education</h4>
        <p>
          Research and education are vital to preventing climate change and we
          are proud that so much is being done across the University of Oxford
          to improve our understanding of climate change and to create
          innovative solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A crisis such as the climate emergency should be tackled in as many
          ways as possible. We believe that cutting and offsetting carbon
          emissions are crucial actions we should take, alongside research and
          education, to prevent irreversible climate change.
        </p>
        <h4>Accountability &amp; Impact</h4>
        <p>
          Detailed information is available about the four projects Brasenose
          College is supporting and each is carefully audited to ensure that
          they meet their objectives.

        <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <p>
          Brasenose College's ambition is to continue to measure, reduce and
          offset emissions from its own operations.
