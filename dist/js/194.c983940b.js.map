We want your voice in our approach.\n        </h3>\n        <h4>A Step Towards Carbon Neutrality</h4>\n        <p>\n          Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is essential if we are going to\n          prevent potentially catastrophic climate change.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Brasenose College is determined to be part of the solution. We are\n          stepping up to the challenge by working with students, Fellows and\n          select carbon offset projects from around the world that the College\n          willsupport.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Each project removes, reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions while\n          assisting local communities\n        </p>\n        <h4>What is Carbon Neutrality?</h4>\n        <p>\n          Our carbon footprint is the greenhouse gas emissions we cause,\n          expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). To achieve carbon\n          neutrality, we must reduce our carbon footprint and offset any\n          outstanding carbon emissions. Carbon emissions can be offset by\n          removing the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\n          or preventing the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide from entering\n          the atmosphere in the first place.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We recognise that it is important to prioritise reducing emissions,\n          which minimises the need for offsets. Equally, offsetting emissions\n          can be an important part of an environmental strategy, particularly\n          where reducing emissions is challenging or will take time, as is the\n          case given our historic buildings.\n        </p>\n        <h4>A Step Change</h4>\n        <p>\n          Brasenose College is reducing its carbon footprint by using renewable\n          energy sources as well as cutting direct and indirect energy\n          consumption. But we acknowledge that we are facing a climate emergency\n          and we must do more, now.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          That is why we have teamed up with\n          <a href=\"https://alliedoffsets.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopen\"\n            >AlliedOffsets</a\n          >, for the second year running, to offset the carbon emissions from\n          the Collegeâ€™s day to day operations. With their help and input from\n          Brasenose students, Fellows and staff we will support a number of\n          emissions reduction projects around the world.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Reaching Net Zero Carbon</h4>\n        <p>\n          Before talking about being carbon neutral, or reaching \"net zero\n          carbon\", we believe it is important to understand what those words\n          really mean. How big is our carbon footprint? How much can we reduce\n          it? And how quickly? These are difficult and complex questions that we\n          are already exploring.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Meanwhile it makes sense to start cutting and offsetting carbon\n          emissions straight away. Preventing catastrophic climate change\n          tomorrow means taking action today.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We embrace our responsibility to do that, and also acknowledge that\n          offsetting carbon emissions in no way diminishes the need to cut our\n          carbon footprint as quickly as possible.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Research &amp; Education</h4>\n        <p>\n          Research and education are vital to preventing climate change and we\n          are proud that so much is being done across the University of Oxford\n          to improve our understanding of climate change and to create\n          innovative solutions.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A crisis such as the climate emergency should be tackled in as many\n          ways as possible. We believe that cutting and offsetting carbon\n          emissions are crucial actions we should take, alongside research and\n          education, to prevent irreversible climate change.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Accountability &amp; Impact</h4>\n        <p>\n          Detailed information is available about the four projects Brasenose\n          College is supporting and each is carefully audited to ensure that\n          they meet their objectives.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          <strong><em>Select a project to learn more about it:</em></strong>\n        </p>\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"#/projects/project-one\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopen\"\n              >South Jordan Landfill Gas Capture</a\n            >\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"#/projects/project-two\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopen\"\n              >Burn Stoves Project in Kenya</a\n            >\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"#/projects/project-three\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopen\"\n              >Turkey Duzce Aksu Province</a\n            >\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"#/projects/project-four\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopen\"\n              >Pacajai REDD+ Forest Protection</a\n            >\n          </li>\n        </ol>\n        <h4>Next Steps</h4>\n        <p>\n          Brasenose College has committed to continuing to measure, reduce and\n          offset emissions from its own operations.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Further Reading</h4>\n        <p>\n          The UK government is the first major economy to pass net zero\n          emissions law.
